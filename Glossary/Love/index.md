**Love**

Love is the interaction between [Unity](../Unity) and [Infinity](../Infinity). This interaction manifests on many levels in the [Universe](../Universe). Whenever that which exists interacts with that which doesn't, you'll find love manifesting. 

Some notable examples of the manifestation of Love: 

- When matter arranges itself in such a way that it can marry with agents of [Change](../Change) like thermal vents in an ocean, convection currents in the atmosphere, or even the long dance of celestial bodies, the matter is able to harness the cycles of Change to create [Life](../).
