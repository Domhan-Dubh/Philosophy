**Infinity**

Infinity is the label we give to the undefined and undefinable things in our [Universe](../Universe).

It is the opposite and compliment of [Unity](../Unity).

Its nature is to disolve both quantitative and qualitative aspects of things by removing the limitations that make somethign finite. The interaction between Infinity and Unity forms the basis for all action and change in the Universe.
