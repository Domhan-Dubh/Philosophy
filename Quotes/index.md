> Love brought us from the world of unity to that of variety, and the same force can take us back again to the world of unity from the world of variety.
>      
>    Hazrat Inayat Khan

This is a beautiful quote from a very religious and philosophical mind but it shows two basic misunderstandings:

1. That our life in this reality some kind of bouncy ball that takes us right back to where we came from making the whole bounce seem useless. It is more likely that the life of the [Universe](../Gloassary/Universe) is a spiral and we don't go right back to where we were. Instead, we are following a rhythmic system of phases through the relationship of Unity and Infinity. A great analgoy for this is the seasons that are created through the relationship of the Earth and the Sun. 
2. This quote also attempts to treat "the world of unity" and "the world of variety" as opposite ends of some universal path. Instead, it seems more accurate to acknowledge that, all of the variety we see, experience, and are, exists within the [Unity](../Gloassary/Unity) and there for cannot be opposite or even separate than it.
